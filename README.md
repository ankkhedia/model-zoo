The ONNX Model Zoo is a collection of pre-trained models for state of the art models in deep learning, available in the ONNX format. Where supported, the models are also available in the  [Model Server](https://github.com/awslabs/mxnet-model-server) archive format. Accompanying each model are [Jupyter](http://jupyter.org) notebooks for model training and running inference with the trained model. The notebooks are written in Python and include links to the training dataset as well as references to the original paper that describes the model architecture. The notebooks can be exported and run as python(.py) files.

## What is ONNX?
The Open Neural Network eXchange ([ONNX](http://onnx.ai)) is a open format to represent deep learning models. With ONNX, developers can move models between state-of-the-art tools and choose the combination that is best for them. ONNX is developed and supported by a community of partners.

## Models

### Image Classification
This collection of models take images as input, then classifies the major objects in the images into a set of predefined classes.

|Model Class |Reference |Description |
|-|-|-|
|<b>[MobileNet](models/image_classification/mobilenet/)</b>|[Sandler et al.](https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.04381)|Efficient CNN model for mobile and embedded vision applications. <br>Top-5 error from paper - ~10%|
|<b>[ResNet](models/image_classification/resnet/)</b>|[He et al.](https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.03385), [He et al.](https://arxiv.org/abs/1603.05027)|Very deep CNN model (up to 152 layers), won the ImageNet Challenge in 2015. <br>Top-5 error from  paper - ~6%|

### Face Detection
These models detect the presence of faces in images. Some more popular models are used for detection of celebrity faces, gender, age, and emotions.

### Object Detection & Segmentation
These models detect the presence of multiple objects in an image and segment out areas of the image where the objects are detected.

### Semantic Segmentation
Semantic segmentation models will identify multiple classes of objects in an image and provide information on the areas of the image that object was detected.

## Model Serving
 Want to try out models instantly? Many of the models in this model zoo can be served with [Model Server](https://github.com/awslabs/mxnet-model-server) using the model archives provided. Model Server is a flexible and easy tool to serve deep learning models by providing a REST API with an inference end point. Supported ONNX models such as those converted from Chainer, CNTK, MXNet, and PyTorch can be served with Model Server. To learn about ONNX model serving with Model Server, refer to the [Model Server ONNX documentation](https://github.com/awslabs/mxnet-model-server/blob/master/docs/export_from_onnx.md).

## Model Visualization
You can see visualizations of each model's network architecture by using [Netron](https://lutzroeder.github.io/Netron).
